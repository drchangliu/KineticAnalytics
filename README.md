# Kinetic Analytics

Kinetic Analytics is a project that makes use of the kinect's skeleton tracking system in order to calculate the energy expediture and record the movement of the user over time. The application has a whole host of features, described below:

*	The ability to adjust energy expenditure based on user height
*	Automatic data post processing to account for situations where the kinect loses track of joints for a period of time.
*	A playback feature that plays back the post processed data
*	Data outputted in several different formats, for use in excel, direct kinect playback, and as raw, unformatted data
