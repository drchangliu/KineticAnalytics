# Kinetic Analytics

Kinetic Analytics is a project that makes use of the kinect's skeleton tracking system in order to calculate the energy expediture and record the movement of the user over time. The application has a whole host of features, described below:

*	The ability to adjust energy expenditure based on user height
*	Automatic data post processing to account for situations where the kinect loses track of joints for a period of time.
*	A playback feature that plays back the post processed data
*	Data outputted in several different formats, for use in excel, direct kinect playback, and as raw, unformatted data

## Major functionality

### playbacktest

The playbacktest directory holds all the files required to take a kinect playback file generated by our app and output it as a video that plays at 30 frames per second. Kinetic-Playback is a light tool that allows for the interpretation of data without a user having to resort to using another piece of software, such as matlab, for data visualization.

### outputmod

Outputmod's features and files represent the core utility of the application, which is to collect, process, and output data about a user's position, movements, and calorie expenditure over the duration of a recording. The range of uses for this are wide, and could have many applications in the medical field as a cheap and convient alternative to using motion capture to gather data about patient gait and motion analysis.
